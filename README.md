# Simple-Shiny-App
Simple app with slider widget, an R data set and user instructions

Assignment:
Keep it simple so that user can take a brief moment to evaluate. Use what you've learned in class.

Write a shiny application with documentation of whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
The application must include the following:

Some form of inputwidget: slider
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R - select bin number using slider
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations - histogram reflects user-selected number of bins
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
